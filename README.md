# Pokebook

This is a personal project by [@smmmfrd](https://github.com/smmmfrd).

All Pokèmon data & images are from [PokèAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

The favicon is the [fame checker.](https://github.com/PokeAPI/sprites/blob/master/sprites/items/fame-checker.png)

Pokèmon is trademark of Nintendo.

## Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## How it works

This is a normal Next.js app with Typescript for type safety, Tailwind for easy component styling, and TRPC + Prisma for typesafety between front and backend.

[The Schema file](schema.prisma) is the single-source-of-truth for this project's database and generates the prisma client used on the server for querying and modifying that database.

The base data is generated by another repo, found [here](https://github.com/smmmfrd/pokebook-dex) and the database is hosted on Planetbase.

### Story Behind

The final project for The Odin Project is to make a social media site, but I went a step further and used a stack that leverages an ORM and the tool I've wanted to use since I started learning web development, Typescript.

I chose to make my social media site only communicatable via pokemon speech because of moderation worries.

### Future Plans

Currently I am about to add the ability to be signed in as a guest so that users can try the app out without having a Discord account.

Next up is letting users write reviews on items, liking or disliking them, and those reviews showing up in normal feeds.
