# Pokebook

This is a personal project by [@smmmfrd](https://github.com/smmmfrd).

All Pokèmon data & images are from [PokèAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

The favicon is the [fame checker.](https://github.com/PokeAPI/sprites/blob/master/sprites/items/fame-checker.png)

Pokèmon is trademark of Nintendo.

## Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## How it works

This is a normal Next.js app with Typescript for type safety, Tailwind for easy component styling, and TRPC + Prisma for typesafety between front and backend.

[The Schema file](schema.prisma) is the single-source-of-truth for this project's database and generates the prisma client used on the server for querying and modifying that database.

The database itself is hosted on Planetscale and the base data is generated by another repo, found [here](https://github.com/smmmfrd/pokebook-dex).
